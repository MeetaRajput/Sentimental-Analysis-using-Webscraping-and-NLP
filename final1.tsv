For day to day use this smartphone is easily capable of doing all things  if you use your phone as a tool that is. It will deliver all your needs. Though with some lags here and there you will not regret it because of the   k price bracket. Battery almost gets   full day on normal use with  G. If you use your ur phone all day then you have to charge in the middle. Simple games also runs effectively but not for heavy games like BGMI only gives   fps  though its very clear this smartphone is not targeted for gaming audience. If u want a budget phone to do daily stuff browsing  social media  whatsapp  payments  camera etc with good after sales service and from a prominent brand with no bugs and glitches here and there then u won t have any issue. Good for old people too.	1
I brought it for my mom. It s a very good smart phone. Camera quality is very good and image processing of Samsung is nice. Battery performance is excellent. Processor of this phone is good for day to day tasks. My mother is very much impressed with call quality. Only drawback is there is no charging adaptor in the box. I had purchased it separately with 9 rs..	1
I have bought this phone as a temprary replacement for my S   after that phone developed display issues. So far its xoing well. The standout point of this phone is its excellent battery. My S   usually lasted about      hrs on medium usage. This phone however has lasted     hours.I will update about the other features some days later.	1
display is pretty  but call quality is bit compromised for budget i think  batteryfast charging for namesake   G connectivity are good  camera is average  single speaker is nothing to be singled out but sound via headphones i use Bluetooth jbl  boat  is great and can do quite a bit of heavy gaming ...my verdict....shed a bit more money if one can and go for redmi     G.	1
Mobile battery camera and ram is good  thank you amazon fast delivery  mobile is over heating and no provide the power adaptor take the complaint and forward the mail samsung company  very bad   k investment and take the mobile but not provided charger adaptor    v power adaptor provide the all samsung mobies please	1
Justifying price. Carrier aggregation is available in  G. Battery life is great. Feels smoth.  G network is also good. Camera is good considering in this price. Phone is little heavier side. Network speed feature is not there.This phone is for medium  users. Samsung should provide fast charger   back cover.	1
bulky  fast charging for namesake  no status light  audio quality not good	1
Good in battery backupHeavy weightSlow phone  not fast as   gb ramCamera quality should be betterSpecially front camera during videocall	1
Phone is overall good having lots of features   but the material used in back feels bit cheaper . Phone official weight is   grams but the weight distribution makes it easier and light to carry   fonts and wallpapers are paid not more options  colour pallete is available only on default theme   camera quality is impressive i think best camera in this range   battery is also good just charge it once a day and forget for   days   software and hardware performance is excellent  little bit warmed up on heavy task bt u can egnore it   I prefer the   GB Ram variant .	1
I m using for the past   days.Pros  Though weight is around  gms  weight distribution is excellent. Build is sturdy  g works fine.  Battery is excellent.  screen is brighter than IPS panel.Manageable under direct sunlight although don t expect amoled level vibes.  speaker is suprisingly loud and clear.Cons Only thing that let thisphone down is the Exynos processor. It has thermal throttling issue. It gets warmer quickly when u push the phone . Which I won t expect from samsung but alas it s Exynos processor it is the way it is.So if u are a light users who uses the phone only for multimedia social media and taking calls and average level of multitasking. In short if u are a light user go for it.	1
By buying this product you are purchasing the best phone under  k which is not Chinese . I would recommend all to kindly avoid Chinese made cellphone though they are manufacturing in India . It s a joy to see that Samsung is also making phone in India. the only regret is that they don t provide charger which should have come at this price.	1
I am a regular user  writing this review after use of one week. Battery last up to      days which is very good. Both cameras back   front  are very good. Colour quality is nice. Build quality is also nice  I have not observed any heating issue while charging or using the phone. Only thing is missing is charger  which has to be provided along with the phone for better life of phone. For not providing the charger I am giving   stars else it would be   stars.	1
It s worth for money in this price range  performance of the mobile and the camera is   	1
Best budget phone  charger not included is drawback	1
Nice product from Samsung  camera  battery are good. Battery coming for   day   .  days for me	1
Best Battery    Phone under   k right now.As of Now due to unstable  G network and Lack of VoNR network phone switches between VoLTE and  G thats why power consumption has been increased hence resulting in fast battery draining than expected.I hope samsung will soon rollout VoNR support for this.Camera is Decent Not a Great Camera Phone TBHProcessor is superb For this price rangeHas Audio Jack  . mm Bonus PointYou have to purchase the adapter   W by Original Samsung ReccomendedTry to apply bak offers and Exchange so that you ll get it at the best price	1
It s having heating issue a bit. When you open   or   apps together then the heating issue occur  rest phone is all ok.	1
After all the hype around this phone. I must say i am disappointed with this because of how bad it feels in hand...The in hand feel of this phone is not good at all. it is bulky and doesn t enhance your media consumption experience.Comes preloaded with unnecessary apps and its quite a hassle. The sound output is on the lower side as well.  G is not good either. The device is not supported by airtel check airtel  g compatible phone list before you buy	1
Nice phone	1
Good product	1
Why is samsung not giving charger to this phone. We need to buy it differently  Useless policy  Nothing environment friendly in this policy. If a customer dosent have adapter he needs to buy it. It will put extra burden on environment as the delivery truck will move one more time. It is helping env. or destroying it.Phone is good  but display could have been better  camera average quality.	1
The only issue is charger not included in box	1
EXCELLENT PHONE........AT THAT PRICE.....BATTERY LIFE .....AND SPEAKER JACK QUALITY...SUPERB....NEW USERS AND BEGGINERS ARE ALSO GO WITH SAMSUNG.....ACCTUALLY I M BIG FAN OF SAMSUNG...	1

Charger cable received with C Pin both sides unable to charge to mobile	1
Good mobile.	1
Play Video Ordered it for my Dad. Samsung never disappoints. Decent screen and camera quality. Performance wise its so good  did not face any issue till now. Seen other bad reviews  probably they are using it with other unwanted apps  bloatwares and expecting very high end gaming performance. Even I bought only  GB RAM version and it works like a charm without any hiccups   G carrier aggregation   G reception and speed everything works fine. Only CON was I had to purchase   W adapter separately which adds additional cost because of only which giving   star rating otherwise would have given     .	1
Battery backup and camera quality good	1
Camara  superb photos    battery back also to good .. Overall superb nice products .. Thank you	1
There is no adapter.	1
Slightly heating issue	1
The mobile is functioning as expected and value for money spent	1
A great battery back up  very efficient   gb ram which ensures fast switching between different apps	1
I am not big on camera usage  personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera  based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome  but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse  heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging  but it was just a little and so that can be ignored. This is ok with me as  I don t perform huge data loads regularly  this phone is for more than some basic stuffs such as checking mails  attending office meeting on phone  watching a video  using WhatsApp  Instagram etc. Personally  this is good for me.At this price range  this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently  this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage.Battery of this phone is one of the another good reason to buy this phone.	1
Good product	1
This phone is an overall value for money.I got the whole package for      and by whole I mean   Phone     W Samsung Adapter   Back Case  these were bought fairly recently in the sale.Coming to the Cons first  since they are very minimal  . No adapter  back case out of the box. . Kind of an outdated design   water drop notch vs punch hole  I would prefer the latter. . No ultra wide camera. . Bezels are a bit thick at the neck area. . Sort of a heavy device. . Only   W peak charging capability. . Few bloatwares pre installed  but uninstallable. . No wifi   ax9. No stereo speakers . No IR blasterNow  I have been very nitpicky here and I would only mind the first  third  eight points and to a small extent  the sixth point  since I am at heart  a performance oriented person.Coming to the Pros  this one is going to be an exhaustive list  .   years of OS upgrades  so you can see it running android    as well and thus is coupled with   years of security upgrades as well   This is huge  By the way  it is android    out of the box. . Type C to C cable included in box  futuristic. . PLS LCD panel used  better than an IPS display. . Camera performance is good for the price. .  mAh battery   no worries of charging. . Widevine L  support. . Good bright display  visible in sunlit conditions. . Good enough volume.9. Yes  A dedicated memory card support  .     G bands  future ready for sure  Also  G  carrier aggregation works well.  . Exynos      nm  ensures a good battery life and is also better than the Snapd  9  atleast on paper   Now this is a big deal   9  is the midrange king  even now and this phone offers a better processor at a much less price  unbelievable   .     GB storage  this is uncharacteristic of Samsung  they would ve given only   GB if they weren t serious about this phone.  . 9Hz display  phew they didn t forget this.  . Voice focus mode for better calls in busy areas.  . Ufs  .  storage type  speed ensured.  . Gorilla glass   protection.  . Samsung service centers being one of the best and omnipresent  you will not have to worry about device issue resolution.So  this is pretty much it. I believe the only legit competitor this phone has  at the time of writing  is Moto G   and the M   wings it effortlessly.Conclusion  I have never liked Samsung  if I am being real  but this phone gave me almost no serious lackings. So  yeah  for the first time I feel that Samsung has actually launched an immensely value for money device. It is indeed the complete package and I believe I got it at a ridiculously low price.	1
Recived without data cable  C to CNo data cable in box.Great work.	1
fantastic phone from samsung. i like it.	1
Nothing new to say  just a good old version M series mobile.. good battery  camera is optimal  storage is good. But leaving charger adapter is not ideal...	1
Overall it is good but when charging that time mobile is heating little bit. The original adapter is nearby    rupees. This mobile cost me around    . Not happy.  th may it was of   99  GB     gb and on  th May price changed to   99.	1

Back panel is loose otherwise phone is good.	1
Phone is great as Samsung is the only company giving   year android updates  just uninstall all extra apps that Samsung has pre installed and also go for  gb model.	1
It s a good budget phone  good ram  gb however one must note anything less would be troublesome as new UI needs ram  maybe the google android version takes up more ram just like windows ....Camera is good under proper light conditions   not for dark areasWill update further after some usage	1

The only negative is LCD display.other things are fine	1
This phone says battery is   but it gives power backup for only       hours so the battery is not much good   this battery makes this phone heavy if u willing to buy this phone for battery backup then Don t hut if u want to purchase phone with good features   brand then go for this.	1
I purchased on the day it released into market. . Delivery  I order from Amazon around   pm and received at    pm. . Pros  good Battery backup long lasts for   day for me  Exynos    processor good for low setting gaming  no heating issue till now and no hanging problem  camera both good quality for money. . Negative  they won t provide charger along with phone  slow charging.When compared other brands  for   k  It s good.	1

Good phone. Battery back up is good. Speed is decent. Touch is excellent	1
I like this phone. Camera quality is good. Phone is lightweight	1
Most things on this phone is good but this phone doesn t support gcam. Cam picture quality is very very bad. Do not buy it for camera. My old xi 9 phone has better camera. BAD PICTURE QUALITY EVEN IN  MP PHOTO.	1
Selected for my son s request. He is very happy after receiving the phone parcel.	1
 . When battery is your priority because of   mah it is heavy. . Battery I am testing I will update after some time. . Screen brightness is way less than my   years old which. . Speaker quality is average.Otherwise smooth and we ll balanced phone camera is also decent.	1
Product is OK. But the C type charger cable does not function despite trying with many adapters. I was forced to use a suitble cable from a friend.	1

 Budget phone   	1
 st Amazon delivered it in less than    Hr that too in a Tier   city.  Phone is actually very good ok build quality and feels nice in hand.Teal green colour looks refreshing.Camera is above average for the segment.Call quality is very good with voice mic boost option  even in public crowded area it is clear.Only down side I feel is that quality of screen could have been better even   year old phone in the same segment has better colour gamet screens.My old MI QC .    W charger charges it quickly surprisingly support PD and QC both type of quick charging  samsung own    W charger is only      min faster.Overall a good experience for the One UI though there are some un installable apps but nothing like in Chinese competitor in this category.At this price Samsung should have gone with a better screen  it would have made this phone a deal breaker in the segment.	1
Best fone	1
I bought this phone at a price of    9 with a card discount of  . Now after   days  I can see I could have got the same device at    9. Can t trust these companies of price point of view.By the way  phone is really good. Battery is best  way better than flagship S   which I already use. Speed is decent  multitasking is also good. Loving the experience.	1
No slo mo. No item removal in photos despite being a latest model. Budget friendly phone though.	1
you have not given the adaptor for charging the mobile. If you had given me the adaptor the mobile should be the charged.Add the amount of the adaptor cost.	1

I M SEARCHING FOR GOOD BATTERY BACKUP PHONE AND I FOUND  A GOOD  G PHONE  GOOD BATTERY BACKUP  GOOD DISPLAY SOND IS TOO LOUD AND CLEAR I WOULD SAY PERFECT    FOR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE NOT MUCH USAGE OF PHONE.I M REVIEWING AFTER   DAYS OF USE  I CALLED MORE THEN   HOURS   LISTEN SONG MORE THEN   HOUR  PLAYED GAMES   HOUR  PLAYED YOUTUBES MORE THEN SEVEN HOURS  I DID THIS ALL TEST DIFFERENT DAYS AND BATTER IS LAST LONG.IF MY PARENTS US THIS PHONE BATTERY LAST LONG   DAYS..WITH CALLS AND MUSIC.ALSO GOOD FOR GAMING   I HAVEN T FOUND ANY ISSUESPERFECT BUDGET PHONE  MUST BUY IF YOU HAVE NORMAL USAGE..NO NIGHT BATTERY DRAINS IS PLUS POINT.FEATURES ARE AWESOME WHEN IT HAS HEAVY USAGE AND FOR COOL THE PHONE DARK THEME WILL AUTOMATICALLY APPLIED EVERYWHERE .	1
Camera is waste at this price. Even a      K range mobile Realme can give the best photos than This... Totally disappointed with the camera s resolution	1
I am little bit confused. its waking perfectly but after some day display start flaking. But overall ph is good. U can go for it. Samsung display are usually good.	1
Compared to f  This one lags.Bought this for  g	1
Play Video	1
Battery is   mAh but not working accordingly. It is     in the morning and by   in the evening it comes down to     . That too on normal usage u.e no gaming or watching videos.	1
I bought two M   together  but both are having different screen display . I have not installed any applications or updates  and checked whether all the settings are same or not  but still the display light is different from both the phones. One ja yellowish white and other is normal white. Anyone noticed it 	1
I think M   is better than this. This phone heat too much may be software is not very compatible to hardware right now and over the time it may get better but speculation is a different thing and what we are right now is not enough and have many issues.	1
Network issue problem with camera very bad   	1
Call Audio quality is poor	1
No screen mirroring smart screen 	1
Mobile heating when small game playing. Waste of money . Opt other mobile brand. Really disappoint with mobile.	1
Camera is rubbish	1
Good mobile	1
Selfie not good pic	1
Very less volume	1
Phone is okay in the budget. Good battery backup. Okay okay Performance sometimes hangs. Side button not working perfectly	1
Cons   Some times getting network issues and   Device hangup while receiving calls...  Camera is just Ok.Pros   Battery Backup	1
Overall a good budget phone with a decent camera and great battery life.Pros  . Display is good at this price point as it supports FHD    Viewing angles are great infact.Thanks to 9hz refresh rate which make the scrolling smooth.Bezels are bit thick than usual phones at this price range. . Great battery  mah   Even with the heavy usage I m getting   9hrs of screen time. With moderate use I ll get around  hrs.Charging typically take      hours to fully charge.I recommend to maintain a charging cycle of       as recomened by samsung. . Camera   Main camera takes good pics   It maintains a balanced dynamic range  portraits are also good for this budget price. Blurs both humans as well as objects.I m disappointed with the vanish of wide angle camera. Instead of dept and macro they could have provided a wide angle cam. . Performance is good for the price range. Casual gaming does the job fine. Can t rely for heavy games. .  . mm headphone jack is a blessing from samsung which most of the companies ignore. . Speaker is loud n good but now good as stero. . Voice focus works well too in noisy environment. . All the    essential  G bands are available which a good with  OS upgrade and  yrs of security patch.But no NFC  no Carrier Aggrigation support.Also no IP rating.I will recommend for people who mostly use the phone for media consumption more and moderate users who don t do gaming.	1
there is no smart view optionand screen sharing option	1
Camera is poor . Rest OK.	1
Only phone no charger.	1
Good. But charger must be given with Samsung mobiles.	1
Finally got  G supporting worth smartphone at this price which do supports both Airtel and Jio  G with    Bands compared to other who either support one and doesn t support other one  Also Battery capacity doesn t disappoints but makes phone bit bulky. It s made for those who prefer other activities over game. Binge watching plus IPL is an great experience with this device.So go for it but only if you are ready to spend another max. Rs.   approx because you don t get charging adapter which costs Rs.   on online platforms and their own website. Also if you want a good case you have to spend another Rs. 99 but if you already have   W   W adapter Power Bank with Type A to Type B then just purchase boAt USB Type C Cable   A  .  m A   cable it s worth buying at cost of Rs.99 Delivery Fee of Rs. .	1
Sometime automatically hanging without using	1
Okey..	1
No charger  No Screen guard  No backcover	1
I bought it at Rs.   and it has all the features . Samsung is a good brand with very strong battery support. I am using it for a month now and it is working fine. I recommend this set.	1
Phone is so good but battery    are not	1
Writing a review after   days of very light usage. The phone does as advertised.Pros . Call quality Excellent. A phone is a phone after all and I like the voice clarity in this phone. . Apps  no crashes . Transfer of data from old phone Done with no trouble with Smart Switch. Whatsapp data transfer was quick with  G network. . Screen Brightness good for outdoors . Battery still     remaining after first charging   days ago.Cons . The screen does not go completely black as in AMOLED displays. . The  G is at best a experimental network. Jio says unlimited  g. I have seen download speed upto     Mbps but uplaod speed is less than   Mbps  but the main problem is not speed. The battery starts to drain like anything once I connect to  g network say    in about   minutes while updating aps in playstotre. Please read the article  Samsung phone battery drains quickly on  G service. This is true for any  G phone. Also the phone warms up during connecting to  G network and heavy downloading. So I have kept the power saving switch on and switch it off when I need to connect to  g services. . Bloatwares are holding on tightly. I will have to find ways to eradicate them.Overall I find this phone working nicely  so   Stars. Bought it for Rs  99.	1
One demerit of the phone is heating.Even very low usage of data on only gets heated.Except that everything is good.	1
This I a good phone can t say value for money but it s OK serves the purpose of office use	1
There is no more option in camera.	1
Average features. Wrongly hyped. Don t pay more buy in extreme discount or sale only. Not worth price mentioned.	1
From the first day battery is draining fast.   battery is drained with few hours of usage	1
on that price  you can takefront camera quality is not so good  especially in low light	1
It s a gem at its price point. Go for it blindly. It will never dissatisfy you at this price bracket. What phone Audio  Display  Camera  Battery. Only one con   Samsung should provide charger and case inside the box.	1
The phone is superior in all aspects. I highly recommend buying a screen protector and case along with the phone  even though it has gorilla glass  . It runs One UI core  .  even then it has many features. Also if you are confused between M   and F   lemme tell you that both of them are exactly the same with the only difference being that M   has an extra camera which isn t much useful if you ask me.	1
TRY BUYING M    GB VARIANT FOR PERFORMANCE REASONS.Pros  Good  g connectivity.    Battery is goodstill can not work for straight   days without charging  .Screen size and display quality is very good.Ice silver color is cool design.Ui looks so good.Works smothly for normal task but gaming heats the phone.Best result of camera in daylight photos and videowith stability.Cons Camera is average qualityin low light or at night time.Does not have screen recording and speed meter feature.No three finger screenshot.Takes   . hr to fully charge.Heating while gaming.	1
I love samsung mobiles. Samsung never disappointed me anytime. I am samsung user for last   year. When I am looking to upgrade my mobile to  g. I have choosen this mobile and purchased       with no cost emi on sale. Using last month I doesnot find any issue.	1
First of all I used this device for business purposes  Battery is best part of it almost   days still    remaining  I use whatsapp  youtube  Google Chrome  calls and sometimes camera. All this work like a charm.Look and Display are very nice  Display is big enough for your daily work and to keep in your pocket. camera is batter then other Chinese variants  it has gorilla Glass protection and no IP protection means you need to protect it from water splash.Battery In whole night only use     no bloatware  clean os  not any false battery draining.I used Jio  G works like butter in Mumbai.Used this phone for   days there is no lag I found in any software  software opening is fast.Overall it s best phone for day to day life work and business purposes. I have   GB variant.Again thanks to samsung for providing this marvel for such a budget cost.Amazon delivery is fast delivered on second Day.	1
It s too much heating within few minutes of use	1
Phone started restarting after vey days of usage	1
Battery is good bus camera picture quality is not good	1
Everythings perfect as per the value.Just the charging is too slow	1
At this range not bad.	1
Ok	1
  day battery in normal use   samsung quality and smoothness of software  no bloatware like some other phones   phone works very fast  fast charging works very good with  W apple i pad charger.	1
It s up to date. Large screen. Higher storage capacity. Higher capacity RAM.  G. Habituated to using Samsung and hence the confidence on the product.	1

Good phone in its category in budget segment. Special highlight is it s monster battery Above average camera and ok type performance. This phone is not for a gamer photographer because it can provide you everything in its limit. Never compare it with Galaxy S   Ultra or iPhone    like performance and feature. It is just like comparing Alto with BMW or Ferrari. Where Alto is best known for its mileage this phone is best for its battery endurance.I have bought this for my father and very happy to say that it suites for him for his daily needs. If you are a normal user then go for it without any doubt.	1
I like the color of the mobile. As expected  the battery standby is good. It is suitable for long time users.	1
Disappointed as it s Thik in size and slow in performance as same as all Samsung phones.I just preferred because it s non China Phone and its UI.	1
Awesome mobile from Samsung. In this price it s a good package  specially for the people  who don t want any Chinese phone. SOFTWARE is a big highlight of this smartphone. In addition it powered with   mah battery. Though  G is not stable  it s providing better connectivity than other  G phones. Overall it s a excellent Experience.	1
Camera quality is awesome  display is awesome  speaker is average  connectivity is awesome  overall good phone	1
Great phone at this price  awesome battery backup  little camera bump  nice weight distribution.With    watt charger it takes almost    mins to charge  to   .Also it has   nos.  G sim slot with micro SD card support and  .  mm head phone jack.Overall good phone for normal day to day uses with awesome battery backup.Its battery protection feature I like most.	1
Phone without charger	1
Good phone at this price. Not so great as per the hype created before launching the phone.	1
The phone is good in all respect. There is nothing to dislike. It is value for money	1

Good Quality Samsung Galaxy M     G  GB    GB Like   	1
Camera  Battery  Made Quality   New feature  noise cancellation  during call are bestProcessor is only for normal use not for heavy use somewhere found laggy Processor during useWeight is some more because   mah battery Adapter not included  and if the only cable provide that is also worst because that is also C to C and C type Adapter are more costly	1
Expected more from Samsung.At least Screen Gurad and Protective Case were must have provided.	1
I have been using since   week and good performance and battery backup also good. Camera decent pictures okay for now.Processor also making speed performance no lag as of now.I think it s good fit for parents.For youngsters  it might be difficult to operate more apps in this.For normal usage  it s best and good phone at this prize. G  normal games  no lag  no hear issues  more hours battery backup    days  internet speed and connectivity good.Overall Good and Best and Nice phone in this budgetMy price      9	1

For budget phone it worth it	1
Good for the price.... Offers so many things for   99 Rs. Using from   days. No issues faced...	1
Product is as described	1
This I bought  gb ram for     9 after    cash back offer it s a good phone on this budget previously I bought oppo f   pro and for my spare purpose only I bought this phone which is very good no lagging  no software issues no heating problems I would recommend to buy this product thank you Amazon team	1
The phone is good at specs  but bad at performance. I upgraded my M   to this by exchange  but disappointed as my previous phone was far better in UI and Speed. The android    sucks big time with samsung one UI and i am sad to see most of the camera features gone single shot  hyperlase  slow motion etc along with many other essential settings. The display is crisp but uncontrollable as far as contrast adjustment. No always on display option available  so you will never know whether the phone is charging or not when connected to charger. The UI is pretty bad.  G is just okay  nothing greater than  G now  so cant say much abt that. Camera in full resolution takes about   seconds for a picture to be saved after clicking  this is a serious issue. Overall  the worst M series ever released by samsung.	0

I got the  GB    GB piece along with bank discount for    9. In that price range it is amazing with long battery life  lot of  g bands available  decent camera and good performance. If you are just a casual gamer or want to buy for your parents this is the best choice in this price comparing with others availabe in the market now.	1

In my hands this m    g was working good.I purchased  gb ram    gb storage model.Using samsung   w adapter charging takes   to    mins.No lagging issues and no heat issues noted in   days period.Battery was good.Camara quality also good in this budget.Network speed  voice call focus mode and call Quality also good.But this is not having stereo spekers.Lcd Display  some members dislikes this Display  but in this budget nice Display.Overall i give     rating.	1
The Samsung M   is a great mid range phone for anyone on a budget. It has all the features you need  including a great camera  plenty of storage space  and a fast processor. Plus  the sleek design looks and feels premium. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking for a solid device without breaking the bank.	1
Everything is perfect like price  display  battery etc. Perfect product. I recommend it.	1

Good performance and display.Camera both front and back takes great pictures.Battery life is also good  will sustain for approx.   days using it for one week now and charged the phone thrice.Unfortunately  no charging adapter is included which I believe should have been included.Overall  satisfied with the phone and it s features as well.	1

I bought it for my mum... It is good	1
Smooth and good interface with good Batter life... good for day to day life usage.	1
I purchased this phone via Amazon and following are my observations   . Most of the time phone doesn t select  G network  it remains on  G network  although the company claims it to be fully  G compatible. . Dedicated slot i.e memory slot plus sim card slot has serious issue with memory card detection. Most of the time this phone doesn t detect a memory card and again and again you have to do restart for memory card detection. . If you perform     task at a time  phone gets quite heat up. . Battery life is not that spectacular considering  mAH and RAM management is also not good.	0
Very nice.	1
One of the Best Budget  G Smartphone with Decent Cameras  Strong Battery  Best Android Skin. Only thing u have to remember is to Purchase   Watts Samsung Charger which costs u around 9 to   .	1

It s okay to use as a secondary device and budget wise it justified for it s price. Those who wants samsung brand it will be good choice in budget and usable phone for   years atleast. rest choice	1
I saw that some people said that its hanging  its heating etc. But bhai sahab jo log samsung phone use karte hai unke liye ye  g phone sanjiwani hai. Koi problem nhi koi heating issue nhi hai   bindas le lo samsung brand hai bhai . Ha agar aap samsung ka original   w charger use karte ho tb.Main is mobile ko   star deta hu.	1

Review it after using it for    days And it s waste of money as no return available only replacement is available can get better mobile in the same bugged.   Back camera is useless and of very bad quality.   Samsung keyboard do not have all the required settings have to download google keyboard.    G takes time to connect to the internet.e.t.c    Battery is of  Mah but drain very fast and gives feel that it is only about  mah kind of something.   The processor speed is    good very fast.But i think Samsung could have done better with this mobile. Very disappointedI am wishing should have bought Samsung F   instead of this garbage.	0

I am a preowner of mid range phone Realme X . I started using M    GB version last week. Until now I don t have any problem in places where I used X . But when I use my new phone  call drops frequently  Apps will display no internet  I have to restart to get internet. It s becoming a nightmare for me. Video streaming struggles eventhough I have    GB of jio data left.I thought the monster battery will last for two days but it will last for one day.I bought this phone after comparing specs  and realised how I fooled myself out	0
The phones notch design makes it feel dated plus the   mah battery makes it little heavy as well.Performance wise the phone is OK but not supper snappy.If you have already used a  gb Ram phone then this phone feels super slow .Regular browsing and other stuffs can be managed quite easily and battery back up is great as well.Phone is suited for people above   who don t expect stylish looking or high end gaming Performance but they just want decent camera and regular browsing experience.Kindly do not buy if you re already used to super fast mobiles .	0
Battery back up awesomeDisplay is very goodEverything is fine but their is no charging indication light in this phoneCharging time it s take  .  hrs super fast chargeBuyed charger at samsung storeGot it for   	1
I purchased this phone on the day it was launched and I found defects on the display and the phone was defective. Defective because the portion below the sim slot on the left hand side made clicking sound when pressed which means the case is little bigger than the phone. I returned the phone and the new phone also came with the same defect but now on the right hand side below the fingerprint sensor. I m returning it again. Only good thing is the battery but if it comes with a defect then what s the point  Also when you are spending   more for the charger. Highly disappointed.	0
very good mobile	1

The phone is overall good . Camera is overall quite and video is stable if you want to vlog . The UI interface needed to be improve . You can go for it      	1
The only pros of buying this phone was I availed it with    HDFC Instant discount and No cost EMI and the phone was delivered within    hours of order.Cons  . The battery is same like I used my A s. I don t see any difference with monster battery. . Touch is not working sometimes when we need to attend the incoming call. . When holding the edge and touching the centre of the screen phone starts to flickering. . Case and temporary screen protector is not provided. . No power adaptor and headphones.	0
It is not value for money if you buy it without discount. But if you love samsung ui and their software updates then go for it  cause in hardware there are nothing special in this phone  just usual stuff that a   k phone should have. About  G connection  it is seamless.	1

This is the first samsung mobile disappointed me. Also first phone I asked for replacement.

In one month usage of mySamsung M    gthe phone was suddenly restarted   times. Another problem was when i receive a call sometimes I can t hear voice of other person so i need disconnect and need to call back. There no NFC feature in this phone.	0
Always On Display feature is not on this phone though it was claimed. Speaker quality is not good. Camera editing features should be better. Customer care of Samsung still not helpful.	0
At this price point  this phone is good better than redmi and realme phones	1
It s a pocket friendly and a nice device	1
Pros  it s SamsungCons  it s a cheap Samsung. Don t know why I thought Samsung  even cheap phones might be good. It s not the case.Phone is slow  like a phone from    which is already used for   years. It was a wtf moment for me when even incoming call take   seconds to come on screen so I can swipe to pick it  and for that itself I have to try few type so screen responds. Swipe on home page is okay  but as soon as   apps are open even keyboard takes a second to write each character.GPS is not accurate sometimes  shows me on other side of the road   butchering navigation capabilities.I regret spending    on this phone  it feels a downgrade from my old phone from      which although screen is damage   works smother than this.Buy at your own risk. I regret this purchase.	0

Despite charging the device for   hrs since unpacking  it is not turning on or showing signs of picking up charge. I am thoroughly disappointed with this purchase.UPDATE on May          I took this phone M   supposedly brand new to the nearest Samsung store. They ran a scan and told me that this phone was previously sold on Apr     and it is water damaged. I have reached out to the merchant directly  and am keen that I get a refund for this phone which I cannot use. It has added unnecessary stress to me  needless to mention.	0
Only dislikes The phone has major heating issue  I played a simple youtube video and the phone is hot I think its because of the speakers  whenever I use phone speaker to watch any video the phone is hot Its also lagging  the screen is working as it wats to to work Really bad experience with this phone I was a big fan of sansung  and this one is my fourth samsung mobile since     I used J   J  max  A   and now this M   The A   is working fine.I don t recommend any one to buy this phone.	0

Pros. I have purchsed this phone for my family member...this phone is good...average camera...average perfomance....average display....you can go for this....in this price segment you will not be disaapoint....mobile in looking very premium....pic of this phone is with back cover which i have purchased from market...those who are not heavy user of this phone can purchse blindly....	0
camera and processor is not so good	0
Poor quaility camera. Not recommended. Samsung totally foolished their customers.	0
It s not a good mobile. It s not worth for   K. Screen looks dull n It s not comfortable to see.Back guard is of plastic and Sim slots are not smooth. Adding  K extra  can get a very good mobile from store.	0
In old model phone also have Screen Mirror Option. M    G is New model phone but it haven t that Option.We can t connect with our smart TV. Totally worst phone.I am   year Samsung User. In past I used J  prime  M    M  s. Those all model have that Screen Mirror Option. But this model Totally waste of money.	0

Defective samsung M   has been delivered to me by Amazon. it s thumb side lock doesn t work and the camera is also defective ....i am unable to return it now it is just    days since it is delivered. Very disappointed by Amazon. I will never buy such costly items from Amazon.	0
I made decision in rush. But dont buy this phone. I have redmi note    which was purchased in    . That redmi phone captures far better photos. Both are       gb. This phone has no Always on display.The camera has no wide angle capture function.Camera has highest resolution of   mp in     only. In this mode you can not zoom in zoom out.In other size like    9 or full resolution quality downgrades.Better cameras are available in this price range.Also this phone feels slower. It takes a moment to respond.	0
Recive new phone...I want to update my phone when I install update PHONE HEAT like LAVA...After ahead I use phone for Recharge on AMAZONE PAY phone HANG   time...When Waching AMAZON PRIME any Video Phone Heat Like coal.

Battery kya tel legi jab banda camera hi ni chalayega .. ye to bs sirf hello hi karne ke liye hi h.. or kisi kaam ka ni h.. isse badiya phone to m bna lunga	0
It s an utter disgrace that it comes with no charger and fast charging is not compatible with other brand chargers. Apart from that  it just randomly switches to  g from  g with no option to revert back to  g. It depends on the phone s mood to let you use  g or not  defeating the complete purpose buying a  g device. Utterly useless piece of trash. Do not buy. Better go for a snapdragon processor phone that comes with a charger.	0
After buying I tried to replace or return this M  . But company was refused and technical support is also very bad  telling me lies  and took OTP. It s very bad experience for me. Now I m using this mobile unfortunately. Till now so much heating problem I have faced in every moment.	0

Design   It looks amazing no doubt wonderful look.Battery   It will surely last atleast   day if you are not heavy user.Camera   Without any doubt under sunlight samsung camera is next level and not only rear camera it s selfie camera is surprise to me.Lagging   Yes it will lag for sure.Performance   overall good but can t put this handset in V.good or excellent category.Processor   worst processor i say.Heating   A lot while heavy task  but if you are just using mobile for ur day to day life then sure go for it.Display   You can t get better display than this in the same price segment.Finger print         Overall review  If u r purchasing for heavy use then plz don t but if you want a classy look  good camera under   k then must go for it  I loved it because am a student and i don t use it very long ofcourse not for gaming so for me it s a profitable deal.	1
Exynos processor is not good and its own processor of Samsung. Do not buy Exynos processor phones and i recommend Snapdragon or other processor. Keep that mind before buying this phone.	0

I bought this phone in local market at    k   gb version. Only for  g it s good but in my area  g is unstable and phone heats in  g mode.Display is tft panel at least should have given IPS panel if not OLED.

Used M  s whose camera is much better.Go for any other phone please this model is faulty one . Samsung should have properly tested hardware before launch and software is full of bloatware               	0

I had a realme   before I bought this phone. I used it for about   years and was quite happy with it. The battery still had a lot of juice in it even after t years of use. The resolution of the screen was fantastic. It was thin and light. The only reason I had to change it was because it had slowed due to the old processor. Compared to this M   is bulky that makes it difficult to handle. There are a lot of bugs in the phone. Sometimes the phone freezes while working. Sometimes the touch fails to respond  the Bluetooth has a mind of its own and seldom connects automatically with paired devices. The screen resolution is not too great. Often the phone slows down. The screen is not not as good as in my previous phone. This is the last time I m buying a samsung.	0

I have purchased samsung M    G last week. Since I m using the main thing is battery backup is very good  performance is awesome  budget friendly mobile. One dispointed me that is no slow motion video option.	1
Phone is heavy in weight as compared to other brands . Has heating problem on multitasking .Front camera quality is low . Back camera is good . Fingerprint sensor works amazing .Overall can be used as secondary phone only . Samsung A   or iqoo z  lite is much better options.	0
